// hero/core/sm75_series.hpp - the Turing (RTX 20, compute capability 7.5) kernel series: one opt-in switch.
//
// The Turing kernels of PRs #2069-#2072, #2081, #2091-#2093, #2145-#2146, #2220-#2223, #1821 were measured on one RTX
// 2080 Ti (and a CMP 50HX) and are bitwise equal to the kernels they replace.  We have no sm_75 card to confirm them, so
// they are ON ONLY WHEN ASKED FOR:
//
//   HERO_SM75_PERF=1   turns on every bitwise Turing kernel of the series on a compute capability 7.5 card.
//
// Each kernel keeps the author's own switch, which wins over HERO_SM75_PERF in both directions (=0 off, =1 on, on any
// card where the PR said so for tests).  Nothing here changes a card that is not a 7.5: the check is the card's compute
// capability (HERO_EMULATE_CC=75 counts, so a 75-virtual build on an sm_86 card runs the series for tests).
//
// The numerics-changing Turing options are NOT part of this switch and keep their own explicit opt-ins:
//   HERO_SELECT_SIMT=1|2 (FP32 tiled block scorer), HERO_PA_V2T=1 (v2 prompt attention), HERO_PF_FUSED_SM75=1
//   (fused int8 prompt experts), HERO_BF16_TC=1 (FP16 tensor-core projections).
